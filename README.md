So here I allowed logged in users to “favorite” and “un-favorite” a story. 
Allowed logged in users to see a separate list of favorited stories.
And finally allowed logged in users to remove a story. Once a story has been deleted, I allowed it to be removed from the DOM and let the API know its been
deleted.
